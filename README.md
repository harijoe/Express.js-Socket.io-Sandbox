# Express.js-Socket.io-Sandbox

## Motivation
The installation of a new Express.js 4 application is not behaving well with the socket.io package. Therefore, this repo can be used as a working starting point of any Express.js + socket.io project.

## Description
Contains the same stuff as what `express newProject` would generate, with socket.io working.

## Installation
`npm install`

`npm start`

## Test
`npm install`

`set DEBUG=generator-ejs:server`

`npm start`

Try to connect to `http://localhost:3000/`.

`generator-ejs:server Socket.io user connected` should appear in the console.
